Name: Exec Maven Plugin
Description: A plugin to allow execution of system and Java programs
Group Id: org.codehaus.mojo
Artifact Id: exec-maven-plugin
Version: 3.0.0
Goal Prefix: exec

This plugin has 3 goals:

exec:exec
  Description: A Plugin for executing external programs.
  Implementation: org.codehaus.mojo.exec.ExecMojo
  Language: java

  Available parameters:

    addOutputToClasspath (Default: true)
      User property: addOutputToClasspath
      Add project output directory to classpath. This might be undesirable when
      the exec plugin is run before the compile step. Default is true.

    addResourcesToClasspath (Default: false)
      User property: addResourcesToClasspath
      Add project resource directories to classpath. This is especially useful
      if the exec plugin is used for a code generator that reads its settings
      from the classpath.

    arguments
      A list of arguments passed to the executable, which should be of type
      <argument> or <classpath>. Can be overridden by using the exec.args
      environment variable.

    async (Default: false)
      User property: exec.async
      If set to true the child process executes asynchronously and build
      execution continues in parallel.

    asyncDestroyOnShutdown (Default: true)
      User property: exec.asyncDestroyOnShutdown
      If set to true, the asynchronous child process is destroyed upon JVM
      shutdown. If set to false, asynchronous child process continues execution
      after JVM shutdown. Applies only to asynchronous processes; ignored for
      synchronous processes.

    classpathScope (Default: runtime)
      User property: exec.classpathScope
      Defines the scope of the classpath passed to the plugin. Set to
      compile,test,runtime or system depending on your needs. Since 1.1.2, the
      default value is 'runtime' instead of 'compile'.

    commandlineArgs
      User property: exec.args
      Arguments separated by space for the executed program. For example: '-j
      20'

    environmentScript
      Environment script to be merged with environmentVariables This script is
      platform specifics, on Unix its must be Bourne shell format. Use this
      feature if you have a need to create environment variable dynamically
      such as invoking Visual Studio environment script file

    environmentVariables
      Environment variables to pass to the executed program. For example if you
      want to set the LANG var: <environmentVariables> <LANG>en_US</LANG>
      </environmentVariables>

    executable
      User property: exec.executable
      The executable. Can be a full path or the name of the executable. In the
      latter case, the executable must be in the PATH for the execution to
      work. Omit when using executableDependency.
      
      The plugin will search for the executable in the following order:
      
      1.  relative to the root of the project
      2.  as toolchain executable
      3.  relative to the working directory (Windows only)
      4.  relative to the directories specified in the system property PATH
        (Windows Only)
      Otherwise use the executable as is.

    executableDependency
      If provided the ExecutableDependency identifies which of the plugin
      dependencies contains the executable class. This will have the effect of
      only including plugin dependencies required by the identified
      ExecutableDependency.
      If includeProjectDependencies is set to true, all of the project
      dependencies will be included on the executable's classpath. Whether a
      particular project dependency is a dependency of the identified
      ExecutableDependency will be irrelevant to its inclusion in the
      classpath.

    longClasspath (Default: false)
      User property: exec.longClasspath
      If set to true the classpath and the main class will be written to a
      MANIFEST.MF file and wrapped into a jar. Instead of '-classpath/-cp
      CLASSPATH mainClass' the exec plugin executes '-jar maven-exec.jar'.

    longModulepath (Default: true)
      User property: exec.longModulepath
      If set to true the modulepath and the main class will be written as an
      @arg file Instead of '--module-path/-p MODULEPATH ' the exec plugin
      executes '@modulepath'.

    outputFile
      User property: exec.outputFile
      Program standard and error output will be redirected to the file
      specified by this optional field. If not specified the standard Maven
      logging is used.
      Note: Be aware that System.out and System.err use buffering, so don't
      rely on the order!

    quietLogs (Default: false)
      User property: exec.quietLogs
      When combined with exec.useMavenLogger=true, prints all executed program
      output at debug level instead of the default info level to the Maven
      logger.

    skip (Default: false)
      Alias: skip
      User property: exec.skip
      Skip the execution. Starting with version 1.4.0 the former name skip has
      been changed into exec.skip.

    sourceRoot
      User property: sourceRoot
      This folder is added to the list of those folders containing source to be
      compiled. Use this if your plugin generates source code.

    successCodes
      Exit codes to be resolved as successful execution for non-compliant
      applications (applications not returning 0 for success).

    testSourceRoot
      User property: testSourceRoot
      This folder is added to the list of those folders containing source to be
      compiled for testing. Use this if your plugin generates test source code.

    timeout (Default: 0)
      User property: exec.timeout
      Timeout in full milliseconds, default is 0.
      
      When set to a value larger than zero, the executable is forcefully
      terminated if it did not finish within this time, and the build will
      fail.

    toolchain (Default: jdk)
      User property: exec.toolchain
      The toolchain. If omitted, 'jdk' is assumed.

    useMavenLogger (Default: false)
      User property: exec.useMavenLogger
      When enabled, program standard and error output will be redirected to the
      Maven logger as Info and Error level logs, respectively. If not enabled
      the traditional behavior of program output being directed to standard
      System.out and System.err is used.
      
      NOTE: When enabled, to log the program standard out as Maven Debug level
      instead of Info level use exec.quietLogs=true.
      
      This option can be extremely helpful when combined with multithreaded
      builds for two reasons:
      
      - Program output is suffixed with the owning thread name, making it
        easier to trace execution of a specific projects build thread.
      - Program output will not get jumbled with other maven log messages.
      For Example, if using exec:exec to run a script to echo a count from 1 to
      100 as:
      for i in {1..100}
      do
       echo '${project.artifactId} - $i'
      done
      When this script is run multi-threaded on two modules, module1 and
      module2, you might get output such as:
      [BuilderThread 1] [INFO] --- exec-maven-plugin:1.6.0:exec (test) @
      module1 ---
      [BuilderThread 2] [INFO] --- exec-maven-plugin:1.6.0:exec (test) @
      module2 ---
      ...
      module2 - 98
      modu
      module1 - 97
      module1 -
      le2 - 9899
      ...
      With this flag enabled, the output will instead come something similar
      to:
      ...
      [Exec Stream Pumper] [INFO] [BuilderThread 2] module2 - 98
      [Exec Stream Pumper] [INFO] [BuilderThread 1] module1 - 97
      [Exec Stream Pumper] [INFO] [BuilderThread 1] module1 - 98
      [Exec Stream Pumper] [INFO] [BuilderThread 2] module2 - 99
      ...
      NOTE 1: To show the thread in the Maven log, configure the Maven
      installations conf/logging/simplelogger.properties option:
      org.slf4j.simpleLogger.showThreadName=true
      NOTE 2: This option is ignored when exec.outputFile is specified.

    workingDirectory
      User property: exec.workingdir
      The current working directory. Optional. If not specified, basedir will
      be used.

exec:help
  Description: Display help information on exec-maven-plugin.
    Call mvn exec:help -Ddetail=true -Dgoal=<goal-name> to display parameter
    details.
  Implementation: org.codehaus.mojo.exec.HelpMojo
  Language: java

  Available parameters:

    detail (Default: false)
      User property: detail
      If true, display all settable properties for each goal.

    goal
      User property: goal
      The name of the goal for which to show help. If unspecified, all goals
      will be displayed.

    indentSize (Default: 2)
      User property: indentSize
      The number of spaces per indentation level, should be positive.

    lineLength (Default: 80)
      User property: lineLength
      The maximum length of a display line, should be positive.

exec:java
  Description: Executes the supplied java class in the current VM with the
    enclosing project's dependencies as classpath.
  Implementation: org.codehaus.mojo.exec.ExecJavaMojo
  Language: java

  Available parameters:

    additionalClasspathElements
      Additional elements to be appended to the classpath.

    addOutputToClasspath (Default: true)
      User property: addOutputToClasspath
      Add project output directory to classpath. This might be undesirable when
      the exec plugin is run before the compile step. Default is true.

    addResourcesToClasspath (Default: false)
      User property: addResourcesToClasspath
      Add project resource directories to classpath. This is especially useful
      if the exec plugin is used for a code generator that reads its settings
      from the classpath.

    arguments
      User property: exec.arguments
      The class arguments.

    classpathScope (Default: runtime)
      User property: exec.classpathScope
      Defines the scope of the classpath passed to the plugin. Set to
      compile,test,runtime or system depending on your needs. Since 1.1.2, the
      default value is 'runtime' instead of 'compile'.

    cleanupDaemonThreads (Default: true)
      User property: exec.cleanupDaemonThreads
      Whether to interrupt/join and possibly stop the daemon threads upon
      quitting.
      If this is false, maven does nothing about the daemon threads. When maven
      has no more work to do, the VM will normally terminate any remaining
      daemon threads.
      In certain cases (in particular if maven is embedded), you might need to
      keep this enabled to make sure threads are properly cleaned up to ensure
      they don't interfere with subsequent activity. In that case, see
      daemonThreadJoinTimeout and stopUnresponsiveDaemonThreads for further
      tuning.

    commandlineArgs
      User property: exec.args
      Arguments separated by space for the executed program. For example: '-j
      20'

    daemonThreadJoinTimeout (Default: 15000)
      User property: exec.daemonThreadJoinTimeout
      This defines the number of milliseconds to wait for daemon threads to
      quit following their interruption.
      This is only taken into account if cleanupDaemonThreads is true. A value
      <=0 means to not timeout (i.e. wait indefinitely for threads to finish).
      Following a timeout, a warning will be logged.
      Note: properly coded threads should terminate upon interruption but some
      threads may prove problematic: as the VM does interrupt daemon threads,
      some code may not have been written to handle interruption properly. For
      example java.util.Timer is known to not handle interruptions in JDK <=
      1.6. So it is not possible for us to infinitely wait by default otherwise
      maven could hang. A sensible default value has been chosen, but this
      default value may change in the future based on user feedback.

    executableDependency
      If provided the ExecutableDependency identifies which of the plugin
      dependencies contains the executable class. This will have the effect of
      only including plugin dependencies required by the identified
      ExecutableDependency.
      If includeProjectDependencies is set to true, all of the project
      dependencies will be included on the executable's classpath. Whether a
      particular project dependency is a dependency of the identified
      ExecutableDependency will be irrelevant to its inclusion in the
      classpath.

    includePluginDependencies (Default: false)
      User property: exec.includePluginsDependencies
      Indicates if this plugin's dependencies should be used when executing the
      main class. This is useful when project dependencies are not appropriate.
      Using only the plugin dependencies can be particularly useful when the
      project is not a java project. For example a mvn project using the csharp
      plugins only expects to see dotnet libraries as dependencies.

    includeProjectDependencies (Default: true)
      User property: exec.includeProjectDependencies
      Indicates if the project dependencies should be used when executing the
      main class.

    keepAlive (Default: false)
      User property: exec.keepAlive
      Indicates if mojo should be kept running after the mainclass terminates.
      Use full for server like apps with daemon threads.
      Deprecated. since 1.1-alpha-1

    killAfter (Default: -1)
      User property: exec.killAfter
      Deprecated this is not needed anymore.
      Deprecated. since 1.1-alpha-1

    mainClass
      Required: true
      User property: exec.mainClass
      The main class to execute.
      With Java 9 and above you can prefix it with the modulename, e.g.
      com.greetings/com.greetings.Main Without modulename the classpath will be
      used, with modulename a new modulelayer will be created.

    skip (Default: false)
      Alias: skip
      User property: exec.skip
      Skip the execution. Starting with version 1.4.0 the former name skip has
      been changed into exec.skip.

    sourceRoot
      User property: sourceRoot
      This folder is added to the list of those folders containing source to be
      compiled. Use this if your plugin generates source code.

    stopUnresponsiveDaemonThreads (Default: false)
      User property: exec.stopUnresponsiveDaemonThreads
      Wether to call Thread.stop() following a timing out of waiting for an
      interrupted thread to finish. This is only taken into account if
      cleanupDaemonThreads is true and the daemonThreadJoinTimeout threshold
      has been reached for an uncooperative thread. If this is false, or if
      Thread.stop() fails to get the thread to stop, then a warning is logged
      and Maven will continue on while the affected threads (and related
      objects in memory) linger on. Consider setting this to true if you are
      invoking problematic code that you can't fix. An example is Timer which
      doesn't respond to interruption. To have Timer fixed, vote for this bug.

    systemProperties
      A list of system properties to be passed. Note: as the execution is not
      forked, some system properties required by the JVM cannot be passed here.
      Use MAVEN_OPTS or the exec:exec instead. See the user guide for more
      information.

    testSourceRoot
      User property: testSourceRoot
      This folder is added to the list of those folders containing source to be
      compiled for testing. Use this if your plugin generates test source code.
